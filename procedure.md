## Procedure

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Prepare a 12-muffin pan with cupcake liners/mould.

2. In a bowl, sift all the dry ingredients – flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt.

3. In a separate bowl, add the vinegar to milk and leave it aside for 5 minutes. Once the milk is curdled (buttermilk is ready), combine oil, vanilla & food colour to it and whisk well.

4. Add the wet ingredients into dry and mix until combined. Make sure you don’t over-mix it - as soon as the baking soda and acid in buttermilk meet, they start working their magic by creating bubbles which we don’t want to lose even before the cake/cupcakes are in the oven!

5. Pour the mixture into a mould/cupcake liners not more than two-thirds of the way (it rises a lot in the oven).

6. Bake the cake/cupcakes for around 18-20 minutes at 160°C. A skewer inserted will come out clean, the cake/cupcakes will be shiny and springy to touch. Cool them for about 5 minutes in the pan and then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.

#### Frosting

-  Prepare your piping bag with your choice of a nozzle. Add your frosting and pipe them onto the cooled cake/cupcakes.
